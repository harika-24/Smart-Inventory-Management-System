# Smart-Inventory-Management-System

With the ever-growing needs of the customer, a proper inventory management system has become a necessity. Inventory management is slightly a complex process that requires a lot of human resources, which is tedious and leads to higher expenditure.The project proposes a smart system to automate inventory management. It captures the live feed of the inventory using CCTV, which is then divided into frames. Each frame is passed through deep learning algorithms for object identification and recognition of items present in the inventory. Further, a maintain dynamic count for the articles and automatically update their count as and when required. Once the count of any of the items in the inventory reaches below a threshold value set by the user, an automated order is placed using REST-based APIs of various e-commerce websites after comparing the prices of the object.
